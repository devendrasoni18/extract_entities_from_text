# extract_entities_from_text
Using NLP, extracting entities from given text such as company names, dates, personal names, city names etc.


I have used Stanford pre-trained NER model of class 7 for named entity recognization.

To download above pre-trained model:
	1. Create new directory for corpus in your home directory:
		mkdir /home/NLP
		cd /home/NLP/
	2. Get the model from stanford website:
		wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-ner-2015-04-20
		unzip stanford-ner-2015-04-20.zip


That's it! You are now ready to run the code. :)
